This is a University final project of Programming Concept course, with a group consist of three people, 
where we use java and do the programming on Visual Studio Code.
in this project we make a Vending machine program where you can insert the amount of money and then choose the drinks or food that you want to buy, 
when the amount of money is less than 0 or less than the price of the drink or food that you want to buy, it will inform you that your amount is not enough and you can't buy it,
but if the amount is sufficient or more than the price needed then you can continue till the end of the program.
